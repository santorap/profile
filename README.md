### Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I am a data engineer focused on solving business problems. My tech stack includes [Python](https://www.python.org/) ([Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)) and [SQL](https://www.iso.org/standard/63555.html) ([PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), [SQLite3](https://sqlite.org/)).

You can find more about my professional experience on [LinkedIn](https://www.LinkedIn.com/in/PaulSantora), but in a nutshell I spent 8 years working as a Technology Consultant at [Deloitte](https://www.deloittedigital.com/).

<ul>My clients and projects included a top-5 healthcare company, a top-10 global banking organization, a US Federal Banking Regulator, a top-20 banking organization, a top-50 banking organization, a top-50 technology company, a top-5 global telecommunications provider, several consolidated state education agencies, a non-profit cancer care consortium, a leading global life sciences medical device manufacturer at a top-5 healthcare company, and internal projects within Deloitte. (I provide more detail about this list of clients when sending out my resume, but I like to keep specific client information less visible in the interests of client confidentiality.)</ul>

I'm a graduate of the [Boston College](https://www.bc.edu/) [Carroll School of Management](https://www.bc.edu/content/bc-web/schools/carroll-school.html) with a [Bachelor of Science in Management](https://www.bc.edu/content/bc-web/schools/carroll-school/undergraduate/academics.html), [concentrating](https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/carroll-school/academic-departments/concentrations.html) in [Management Information Systems](https://www.bc.edu/content/bc-web/schools/carroll-school/academic-departments/information-systems/concentration---academics.html) and [Operations Technology Management](https://www.bc.edu/content/bc-web/schools/carroll-school/academic-departments/business-analytics/concentration-academics.html#operations_management_concentration).

I recently graduated from [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/) after studying in their [Data Science program](https://lambdaschool.com/courses/data-science) and completed a [Certificate in Data Science and Machine Learning](https://www.credly.com/org/lambda-school/badge/data-science-machine-learning.1) in Summer 2021.
